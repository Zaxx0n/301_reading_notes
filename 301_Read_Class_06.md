# OSI Model
The OSI model has seven layers:
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presenation
7. Application

In the second layer, Data Link, it is split into two parts: The media access control (MAC) and the data link sub layer.

MAC is the physical address of the device.

Data Link sub layer is functions to establish protocols to the structure of data frames.

OSI Layer 3 is referred to as the "Networking" layer.  It provides the structure relating to how data can be efficently transfered between networks.

# Wireshark 
Wireshark is one of the most useful tools for IT professionals.  It is a network packet capture tool.  It's like a microscope for your network traffic.

Wireshark allows for Packet Captuture, Filtering and Visualization. 

It is used for troubleshooting networks that have performance issues. In cybersecurity, it is often used to trace connections, view the contents of suspect network transactions and identify bursts of network traffic.
