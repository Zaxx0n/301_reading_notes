# CIDR Block Notation

CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block, or a range of IP addresses. In creating a network CIDR makes sure that there are enough IP addresses without being too large and wasteful.

IPv4 addresses are represented as four 8-bit decimal numbers (octets). Each octet is separated by a dot, for example 192.169.56.1.   All for octets add up to 32 bits. Full range of CIDR notation would be 0.0.0.0/0.  The final digit after the "/" represents how many bits make up the mask.

# Network Segmentaion 

Network segmentation is when different parts of a computer network or "network zones" are separated by devices like bridges, switches and routers.  This can be applied in data centers and on premises at facilities.

Key benifits of network segementation:
- limiting access privileges to those who truly need it
- protecting the network from widespread cyberattacks
- boosting network performance by reducing the number of users in specific zones

Network segementation is important to protect your static IP addresses.

Types of Network Segmentation
- Users
- Screened Subnet
- Guest Network
- IT Workstations
- Servers by Department
- VoIP/Communications
- Traditional Physical Security
- Industrial Control Systems
- Customer Databases
