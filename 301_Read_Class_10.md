# Site-to-Site VPN

This is a connection set up between multiple networks. They are useful for having a private and protected traffic.  They are also useful for companies that have more than one office in more than one geographical location.

Site-to-site VPN is now much like what we know as the internet.  It uses protocols, for example TCP/IP. 

There are three types of VPNs:
- Remote Access VPNs
- Intranet-based Site-to-Site
- Extranet-based Site to Site

One might want to use a Site to Site VPN for multiple reasons.  When deciding if it's a good VPN for you think about the number of locations, business size, the distance between each location and the resources the locations have to share with each other.
