# Windows vs Windows Server

They use the same kernel and can run the same software.

Windows is a desktop client that one would sit at and use while server is just that, a server and can run services across a network.

Windows server does have a GUI, but windows recommends not using it to reduce the overhead needed to run it. The Windows Server includes server software. After starting Windows Server with a GUI, a Server Manager program will launch.  From this manager you can add on server specific features.

Windows server support higher-end hardware.

Windows server is locked down.  Doesn't have the bloat (Cortona etc.) that Windows does. It doesn't support signing in with a Microsoft account.
