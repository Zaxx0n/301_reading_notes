# Active Directory
AD is Microsoft's directory and identity management service for Windows domain networks.

It is made up of a number of different directory services.  Some of them are AD DS, AD LDS, AD CS, etc...

The fundamental AD features are: a schema, a global catalog, a query and index mechanism and a replication service.
 
 The AD data structures are in a hierarchical structure consisting of domains, trees and forests.

 Objects in a domain can be grouped into organizational units (OUs) to simplify administration and policy management.

 AD benefits include security, extensibility, simplicity and resiliency.
