# What Is Microsoftâ€™s Patch Tuesday?

Patch Tuesday or "Update Tuesday" is an unofficial term for the day when Microsoft releases update packages for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft software.

Microsoft doesn't release patches immediately, instead they wait until Tuesday. This is done so that Admins can plan for it.  IT professionals know that patches will arrive on the second Tuesday of each month, and they can make plans to test or install them. 

### When Is Patch Tuesday?
Patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month in North America.

### It's not just updates
In some cases Microsoft will send out "out-of-band" updates for security flaws.

### Patch Tuesday is for "B" updates
They are called "B" updates because they are released the second week of each month.  If it's the 3rd "C", 4th "D". The "C" and "D" updates are considered optional.
