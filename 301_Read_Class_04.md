# Group Policy

Group Policy is a feature of Windows that facilitates a wide variety of advanced settings that network administrators can use to control the working environment of users and computer accounts in Active Directory.

They can help increase security to defend against insider threats and external attacks.

### Group Policy Object (GPO)
A GPO is a group of settings that are created using the Microsoft Management Console. (MMC) Group Policy Editor.  It can be associated with a single or numerous AD containers.

GPOs that are in nested OUs work from the OU closest to the root first and outwards from there.

The order that GPOs are processed is known as LSDOU (local, site, domain, organizational unit).
