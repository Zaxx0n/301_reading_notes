# Port Scanning

A port scanner sends a network request to connect to a specific TCP or UDP port on a computer and records the response.

If you wanted to check to see if your web server was operating correctly, you would check the status of port 80 on that server to make sure it was open and listening.

The status helps network engineers diagnose network issues or application connectivity issues, or helps attackers find possible ports to use for infiltration into your network.
