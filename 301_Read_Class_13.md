# Port Mirroring
Port mirroring is also known as SPAN.  It is a method for monitoring network traffic. It is done by connecting to a port of a switch or another network device.  This can be done locally or remotely. 

Mirroring is set up by an administrator.  They select a port from which all packets will be copied and then sent.  The admin can choose what packets are included.  The amount of packets can impact performance.

Port mirroring is the most common form of capturing traffic because it is inexpensive.

Drawbacks of port mirroring:
- it can consume significant CPU resources while active
- there is a risk of not recieving some packets
- congestion is likely to cause the drop of some packets
